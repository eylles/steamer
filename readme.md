A thin steam client shell wrapper to add cli options from config.

config

## notes

This wrapper was something i wrote as a "better" or at least more flexible way
to address [steam #10887](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/10887)

A list of most if not all the steam client cli parameters can be found at:
